# Documentation Structure, Styling and Formatting Guidelines

## Purpose

The purpose of these styling and formatting guidelines is to establish consistent and visually appealing standards for the documentation, enhancing its readability and usability. By following these guidelines, we can create a cohesive and professional presentation that aligns with the project's branding and overall aesthetic.

## Structure Guidelines

Every project-structure follows the following rules:
- Use the default folder structure:
  - 01-introduction
  - 02-reference
  - 03-tutorials
  - 04-releasenotes
- Maximal folder depth is 3

## Document Header

Every Document must contain the following header:

```
---
title: "TITLE"
linkTitle: "Link Title"
type: "docs"
weight: 30 # optional
date: 2030-01-01 # please use actual date
description: # optional
---
```

## General Styling Guidelines

- Adhere to standard spacing rules: Use consistent indentation for code blocks and paragraphs, and maintain adequate spacing between headings, sections, and lists. (1 paragraph per block)
- Utilize whitespace effectively: Employ whitespace strategically to break up text, improve readability, and enhance the overall visual flow of the documentation.

## Heading Styling Guidelines

- Use hierarchal headings: Apply heading styles (H1(#), H2(##), H3(###), etc.) to create a clear hierarchy of information, making it easy for readers to navigate the documentation.The table of contents is automatically created on this.
- Maintain consistent heading sizes: Use heading sizes that are proportionate to their importance, ensuring a clear hierarchy that guides readers through the documentation. (In document only use H2, H3 and H4, the document headings created automatically based on the titel of the document)
- Use headings for major sections: Only use headings for significant sections of content, avoiding excessive headings that clutter the document.

## Code Styling Guidelines

- Use consistent indentation for code blocks: Indent code blocks consistently to enhance readability and make the code structure clear to the reader.
- Wrap code blocks at appropriate lengths: Wrap code blocks at a maximum line length of 80 characters to improve readability and prevent code from overflowing onto multiple lines.
- Use consistent code block styling: Apply consistent styling to code blocks, including background color, font style, and spacing, to maintain a clean and consistent appearance.

## Text Formatting Guidelines

- Use bold and italic styles appropriately: Use bold formatting for emphasis, such as important keywords or key points, and use italic formatting for citations or technical terms.
- Avoid excessive bolding and italicizing: Use bold and italic styles sparingly to maintain visual balance and avoid overwhelming the reader.
- Use a consistent approach to highlighting: Employ a consistent method for highlighting important text, such as using a consistent color or background tint.

## Screenshot Formatting Guidelines

- Use screenshots judiciously: Only use screenshots when they are necessary to illustrate a concept or demonstrate a feature.
- Ensure screenshots are clear and high-resolution: Use high-quality screenshots that are easy to see and understand.
- Caption screenshots appropriately: Provide clear captions for screenshots to explain their purpose and context.

## Links Formatting Guidelines

- Use descriptive anchor text for links: Use anchor text that accurately reflects the destination of the link, providing context for the reader.
- Link to relevant and credible sources: Link to authoritative and trustworthy sources to enhance the credibility of the documentation.
- Use consistent link styles: Apply consistent styling to links, such as underlining or changing font color, to make them easy to identify and distinguish from regular text.

By adhering to these styling and formatting guidelines, we can create a visually appealing and consistent documentation that effectively communicates information to our users, enhancing the overall user experience and project branding.
