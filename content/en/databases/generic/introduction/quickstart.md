## Deployment

### Ordering

Do you need a database quickly? Then we will guide you through the ordering process [here](../../tutorials/ordering/).

### Retrieve Login Credentials

The order process is done and your DBaaS is up and running. The first thing you should do is getting your [Login Details](../../tutorials/retrieve_login_credentials/).

### Create a new Database and User

Use your MySQL Client to [create your first Database and User](../../tutorials/create_db_and_user/).

### Import your Database

You might want to [migrate](../../tutorials/database_import/) a database from an exisiting project.  

### Use the DBaas in your application

Enjoy our Database-as-a-Service. No admin worriesâ€”just connect and go. Focus on your app, we manage the rest.

## Customization

### Scaling

There are two ways you can scale our DBaaS.

- Vertical Scaling: First and foremost you can modify the *Node Size* of your DBaaS Instance. Every option available is discussed [here](../../documentation/nodesize/).

- Horizonal Scaling: Second you can add [Read-Replicas](../../documentation/read_replicas/) to your DBaaS. If your application is capable to distribute read/write operations this feature can highly improve overall system responsiveness.

### Configuration

Everything about the Database Configuration you can find [here](../../documentation/configuration/).

## General Information

### Security

#### Whitelisting Source IP Addresses

Make sure to only allow known Source IP Addresses that your applications use. This helps keep out unwanted bots or crawlers trying to harm your service.

#### Encryption

We require secure, encrypted communication from the client/application to our DBaaS. This way, even if someone intercepts the network traffic, they can't see the data.

If your are getting certification eror make sure the required Let's Encry  (intermediate) certificates are available on the accessing system. [Let's Encrypt certificates](https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/)

### Backup and Restore

Get all details about the backup and restore automations in our [Backup and Restore](../../documentation/backup/) document.

### Updates

Learn about the the Patchroutine for our DBaaS in the [Updates](../../documentation/update/) document.

### Monitoring

We monitor our DBaaS by keeping an eye on both the underlying compute and storage resources, as well as performing database-specific checks. Our 24x7 support team handles any incidents that arise, ensuring continuous and reliable service.

### Regions and AZ

For information on choosing regions and availability zones, check the [Regions and AZ's](../../documentation/az/) document.

### SLA

The infrastructure is fully redundant. We therefore guarantee an SLA of 99.95.
