## What is a pluscloud VMware environment?

Each pluscloud VMware environment is an independent instance of the VMware vCloud Foundation ({{< abbr "VCF" "VMware vCloud Foundation" >}}) stack.
This means that each environment is a self-sufficient stack with its own management systems that support the workload of that environment.

Each pluscloud VMware environment is associated with exactly one Availability Zone.
