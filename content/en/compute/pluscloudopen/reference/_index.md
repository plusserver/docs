  Documentation on working with various features of pluscloud open
---

In this area of our documentation we want to provide some knowledge about the various aspects of the selfservice features of pluscloud open. These features include management of various network features (like subnetworks, loadbalancers, public and private IP addresses and firewall rules), storage (like volumes and snapshots) as well as virtual machines.

Most of these features can be consumed via the web frontend of pluscloud open (called [Horizon](https://docs.openstack.org/horizon/latest/)). Some of those features are only available via the [Openstack Client](https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/index.html).
