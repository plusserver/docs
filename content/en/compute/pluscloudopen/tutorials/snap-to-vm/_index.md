title: "Rebuild an Instance from a Snapshot"

description: >
  Create a Snapshot from your VM, delete it, and rebuild it again
---

## Overview

The scope of this document is to enable users to create a snapshot from an existing vm, delete the vm to remove it from pluscloud open and rebuild the vm again from the snapshot taken earlier. Pre- and post-checks should be done by the user before and after this procedure where needed. 

Note: VM tends to pickup different IPs if not assigned statically. The floating IPs will be detached from VM but they will remained assigned to port in the project.  The floating IPs are billed as long as they are part of the project they need to be removed from the project if not desired.


## Pre-Checks from the User

Please do check below items (you need to know them to rebuild the VM afterwards) before executing the procedure. The pre-checks may extend beyond below items depending on the vm type.

* Attached Networks 
* Network Reachability
* Mounted storages
* Application status
