At PSKE, we take care of Day 1 and Day 2 operations for you, including the lifecycle management of Kubernetes versions.

By continuously updating them, we ensure that you can always use the latest versions of Kubernetes to take advantage of the latest features and reduce the security risk of outdated versions. 

PSKE always supports the latest 3 versions of Kubernetes (supported by SAP Gardener). This also means that older versions of Kubernetes are periodically retired to meet these requirements.
