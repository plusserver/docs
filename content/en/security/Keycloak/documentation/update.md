## Patching Procedure

Our services are routinely patched once a week. The patching process typically runs during the early morning hours. This regular maintenance ensures that service instances stay up-to-date with the latest security improvements and software updates.

Occasionally, during the patching process, there may be brief periods when the service is temporarily unreachable. This can occur when our host systems require system updates to be applied.

## Customizing Your Patch Schedule

We understand that downtime may not always be convenient for your operations. That's why we offer you the flexibility to define your own patching schedule.

Simply provide us with the following information:

- **Day of the Week:** Specify the day of the week that works best for your business, such as "Sunday."
- **Start Time:** Choose the preferred time for patching to occur, for example, 4:15 A.M.

**If you need to customize your patch schedule, please [open a ticket](https://customerservice.plusserver.com/support/ticket-create) with our support team.**

>*We're working on a feature to let you directly set the patch schedule in our customer portal. Until then we thank you for your patience as we improve our services.*
