### Customer portal

You always start in our [customer portal](https://customerservice.plusserver.com)

### Select Keycloak as a Service

First navigate to *Keycloak as a Service*.

### Select Node Type and Node Size

Now select the size and a type of node. You do not yet know what performance you need? Then select the smallest node and scale up later if necessary (planned).

### Select the storage size

You always start with at least 50GB memory for your data.

### Enabling access

The service is accessible via a public IP. As this is freely available from the Internet and could potentially be "attacked" by anyone, we intially block all access to the service. The mere protection provided by an encrypted connection with a user name and password is not sufficient. It is therefore necessary to specify the trusted sources from which the Keycloak as a Service instance should be accessible.
You must enable access from one or more external addresses or address ranges. Ideally, only the one IP from which the service is used is enabled. In this example IP 123.123.123.123/32 and subnet 222.222.222.128/28 will be added to the trusted sources.

### Select the region

Here you can select the [region](/en/general/plusserver-region-az/) in which the service is to be provided.

### Select the invoice profile

Are you a new plusserver customer and do not yet receive an invoice? Then select *New Invoice Profile*. If you are already a customer, you can choose from existing billing profiles and will receive the new Keycloak as a Service billing data on an existing invoice, which you must then select.
