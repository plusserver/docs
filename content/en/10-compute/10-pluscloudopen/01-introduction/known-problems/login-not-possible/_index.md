You have received your initial credentials via e-mail and want to login into Horizon, but that does not work. The login is rejected despite copy and pasting your credentials into the login form. 

The e-mail includes a link to our password exchange, which lets us safely transfer your initial password to you. You might have seen a similar form:

![screenshot of example password exchange](./pwx.png)

If you transferred your new password by clicking on the marked button on that page, and pasted it into the login screen of Horizon, it might have happened, that whitespace was appended to your password.

Please try and mark the password with your mouse and then cut and paste it into the password field of Horizons login screen. If your other credentials are ok, you should be able to login now.

We know, that this is an inconvenience and we want to replace the password exchange with an entirely new tool, but that has not happened yet. We apologize for the inconvenience and hope, that the above workaround works for you, too.
