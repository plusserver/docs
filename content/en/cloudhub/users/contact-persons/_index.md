---

## Where to find it?

The contact persons can be found in the CloudHub sidebar under **"Contacts Persons"**.

![Contact Persons location](../../img/contact-persons/contact-persons-location.png)

## Contact Persons Overview

![contact persons overview](../../img/contact-persons/contact-persons-overview.png)

In general, there are two areas here:

- The management of the contacts themselves
- Sorting the specified contacts into a sequence to be contacted in the event of escalations or other emergencies

## Main contact

This contact is independent of the other contacts.

They are the main contact in all our systems, usually the person who registered or who concluded the contract with us.

There can only be **one main** contact, and this main contact cannot be deleted. The details can be updated in CloudHub. However, this main contact must always be stored.

It is always marked in blue in the table.

## Add, edit and delete a Contact Person

### Add a new Contact Person

First, a few basic contact details are requested

You can then select the issues for which this person should/may be contacted. In the second column, you can also conveniently see whether and which other contact persons have already been informed for this topic.

### Edit a Contact Person

If you click on the pencil icon in the overview, a menu appears on the right-hand side where you can view the information provided. If you want to edit it, there is an “Edit” button at the top right. It looks like this:

![edit contact person](../../img/contact-persons/contact-persons-edit.png)

### Delete a Contact Person

If a contact is no longer needed, it can be easily deleted using the trash can button. You will then be asked if you are sure.

### Escalation Matrix

The contact persons that have already been created can be put in a sensible order here for situations where it is time-critical to get hold of the correct decision-maker at the customer's premises. In addition, you can add information for each escalation level, e.g. on the availability of this person or other information that helps us to act quickly.
