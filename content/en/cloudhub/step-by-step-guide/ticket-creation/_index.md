## Create Ticket

On the ["Create ticket"](https://cloudhub.plusserver.com/support/ticket-create) page, you can create a new support ticket. The form guides you step by step through the creation process and adapts depending on the selected category and, if applicable, template.

### Steps for creating a ticket

1. **Select category:**
   First, select the appropriate category for your request (e.g. technical support, billing, contract questions).
   This selection determines what information will be requested later on.
