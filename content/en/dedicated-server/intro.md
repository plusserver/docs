## Scope

This documentation refers to the standardized dedicated server types listed below.

## Types

A servertype is composed of a class and a variant.

| Class       | Variant | Type            |
| ----------- | ------- | --------------- |
| Essential   | 100     | Essential-100   |
| Essential   | 200     | Essential-200   |
| Performance | 100     | Performance-100 |
| Performance | 200     | Performance-200 |

The specifications can be found in the corresponding section on our [homepage](https://www.plusserver.com/en/product/dedicated-servers/).

## Operating systems

We currently offer Debian 12 and Ubuntu 24.04 as pre-installable operating systems.

### Access data

In order to gain access to your system, an [SSH Public Key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key) must be provided and will be assigned to an initial user.
The name of this user depends on the operating system chosen.

| OS     | Username |
|--------|----------|
| Ubuntu | ubuntu   |
| Debian | debian   |

## Monitoring

Dedicated servers of the mentioned types are automatically monitored for hardware defects. Depending on the circumstances, the hardware defect is fixed proactively and without any further consultation (e.g. hot-swappable SSDs and power supplies). If a system downtime is necessary (e.g. RAM or fan defects), this maintenance will be carried out at a date agreed by you.

## Feedback

If you miss any functions, [we would like to hear about it](https://www.plusserver.com/en/support/#contact).
